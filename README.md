## Setup and Usage

This project is a single-file HTML application, making it incredibly easy to set up and deploy.

1.  **Download the `index.html` file.**
2.  **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.**

That's it! You can host this file on any static site hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) or simply open it locally.

### Customization

To personalize your portfolio:

1.  **Edit `index.html`**: Update `[Your Name]`, descriptions, project details, skill icons, and contact links.
2.  **Replace Placeholder Images**: Update `src` attributes for your photo and project images.
3.  **Adjust Colors/Fonts**: Modify Tailwind CSS classes directly in the HTML or use Tailwind's configuration if you set up a build process (though for a single file, inline classes are sufficient).
